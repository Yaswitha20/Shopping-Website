                <h4>Runway-Inspired Trends</h4>
                <p>However, spring 2022 fashion trends seem to be full of surprises diverging from the patterns of the last few years according to many fashion experts. This can be seen both on campus and on the runways.
                 The latest fashion weeks in New York, London, Paris and Milan signified a new look at fashion after the age of the pandemic.
                 The last two years have been full of fashion that commented on the pandemic itself — famously the Valentino Haute Couture Spring 2021 collection. Audiences may remember a look from this collection that Zendaya wore to the 2021 Critics Choice Awards.  
                 However, this year many of the collections went back to having their own unique, non-pandemic-related, themes. Some traditional houses, like Ralph Lauren, even went so far as to not show at all during the last two years, but came back to show a new collection in the last weeks. 
                 Fashion critic Luke Meagher also noted in a video critique of New York Fashion Week that newcomers such as Elena Valez and Peter Do added a much-needed vitality to the scene. </p>
